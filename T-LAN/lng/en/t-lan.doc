  1. Description.

     T-LAN  log analyser is intended for gathering statistics of a FTN
  system,  that  is using T-Mail or G.P.Mail mailer, creating a system
  load histogram (for one/multiple lines) for a certain period of time
  and  certain  address(es)  and  also  for sending results to echo or
  netmail

  2. Configuration.

  Most of configuration  parameters are  located  in the configuration
  file:
(T-Lan.Ctl)
;*********************************************************************
;***         T-Mail log analyser 0.34 sample control file          ***
;*********************************************************************
;
;RegisterName    The SysOp
; Register string (value by default - Unregistered).
; Defines  a  string which will be shown after 'Registered to:' words
; during  program execution and will be inserted into '^aPID:' kludge
; while posting. It MUST be the first keyword in T-LAN.CTL.
;
;======================= Log analyser section ========================
;
Address         2:0/0
; Defines the main address of system, wich must be exactly the same as
; main address from T-Mail.Ctl (value by default - 0:0/0.0).
; In  T-Mail versions after 2603 the format of displaying addresses in
; log  has  changed  and  now  it  became  possible to define aliases,
; therefore  this  variable is necessary: it is used for processing of
; abbreviated record of addresses in log and in list of aliases.
;
;Aliases         C:\T-MAIL\Aliases.Ctl ; 4D
; File  of  T-Mail address aliases (value by default - no).
; Is  intended  for  correct  work with T-Mail 2603+ where aliases are
; used.  This  variable also replaces real address in reports by their
; aliases.  It  may  be cancelled by indicating parameter 4d after the
; name of aliases file. Up to 512 aliases are supported now.
;
Language        C:\T-MAIL\T-MAIL.LNG
; Defines  the  filename of language support file T-Mail-LNG (value by
; default - English for T-Mail version 2604).
; If  you  use  another  language  and T-Mail version after 2599 it is
; necessary to give here the path to your language file.
; ATTENTION:  It  is  possible to define only one language version for
; all analysed logs.
;
Log             C:\T-MAIL\T-MAIL.LOG ; Kill ; Cut 1000 500
; Defines the name of analysed log. (value by default - no).
; For  multiline  systems  or  for gathering statistics in one log but
; with different values of other variables this is possible:
;[1] Log C:\T-MAIL\T-MAIL1.LOG
;[2] Log C:\T-MAIL\T-MAIL2.LOG
; Available values:
; Cut             - if log size overdue the first defined number of Kb
;                   it will be cut to second defined number of Kb;
;                 - if the first number is negative it means the number
;                   of days to save a log for;
; RenLog          - rename logfile name to a current date in "DD-MM-YY.Lnn"
;                   format after processing, where nn is line number;
; RenExt          - rename logfile extention  to a current day if year;
; Backup          - move processed logs to BackupDir directory;
; Kill            - erase log after processing.
;
;BackupDir       C:\T-MAIL\BACKUP
; Defines  directory  name to place processed logs (value by default -
; no).
;
Templates       TEMPLATE\
; Defines  directory  with  templates for reports  (value by default -
; executable directory).
;
;T-Hist          C:\T-MAIL\T-HIST.$00
; Defines  T-Hist.$??  filename  for  appropriate  log file  (value by
; default - no).
; Correcting  T-Mail  history  file  after  log  cutting  for T-Mail's
; built-in session viewer <Alt-I> to work properly.
;
;CutLog          Squish.Log   1000 500
; Defines filename to be truncated after complete mailer logs analysis
; (value by default - no). Maximum 'CutLog' keywords count is 256.
; Available values:
; 1. If log size overdue the first defined number of Kb it will be cut
; to second defined number of Kb.
; 2. If  the  first  number is negative it means the number of days to
; save  a log for. It will work fine only with T-Mail style or Binkley
; style logs.
;
;Output          C:\T-MAIL
; Directory to hold temporary and report files.  By default it will be
; an appropriate mailer log directory.
;
;Nodes           2:*/*.* 16:*/*.* !123:*/*.*
; Defining the group of addresses (value by default - *:*/*.*).
; Group  of  addresses,  for  creating  statistics. Supports agreement
; about T-Mail addresses. Addresses, that do not enter this group, not
; will be mentioned in statistics.
;
;Period          01/01-31/12,00:00:00-23:59:59
; Defines  the  date and time of beginning and completion of gathering
; statistics (value by default - 01/01-31/12,00:00:00-23:59:59).
; The variable consists of two fields (of date and of time), separated
; by  comma  and  represent  two intervals divided by '-' symbol, made
; according to the following rules:
; 1. The time of interval is by default 00:00:00-23:59:59
; 2. If  the  first field contains symbols '/' it should be understood
; as the date of beginning and end of the analysed interval.
; 3. If  the  first  field  doesn't  contain  symbols '/' it should be
; understood   as  "...days  before  this  (according  to  the  system
; calendar)",  and  the  next after '-' - as "duration" (in days) i.e.
; 'Period 1-1' wich means necessarity of gathering statistics for past
; 24 hours.

(EOF)

     In  a  Poster  section  variables  of  T-LAN.CTL  macros usage is
  available.

  @PID     - string like 'T-LAN/2 0.28.a3'
  @LongPID - string like 'T-LAN 0.28/Alpha-3/OS2'
  @Date    - is available only after log analisys.  Result  is a time
             period string like '02/03 23:00:12 - 03/03 22:11:19'
  @OS      - OS version
  @Uptime  - system uptime (OS/2 version only)

     In  multiline systems it is possible to define numbers of "tasks"
  before  the  variable  name  in square brackets. Their values may be
  between 0 and 253.
     The  priority of variable review is from the beginning to the end
  of file. The order of assignment in T-Lan.Ctl doesn't matter.

  Example 1:                         Example 2:
  (t-lan.ctl)                        (t-lan.ctl)
  [4] Nodes 2:5020/*.*               Nodes 2:*/*.*
  Nodes 2:*/*.*                      [4] Nodes 2:5020/*.*
  ---------------------------------  ---------------------------------
  Here  the  entrance  of addresses  Here  all  lines are analysed: if
  2:5020/*.* in log of the 4th line  they  belong  to the second zone,
  is  analysed,  and also - if logs  as  the  common  variable 'Nodes'
  of  other  lines  - belong to the  given  earlier  overlapps the 4th
  second zone.                       line variable.

     ATTENTION:  In  multiline  mode it is necessary to set the option
  Fake  in  Graphic  variable in order that extra addresses should not
  appear in statistics.

     Besides, T-LAN works correctly only with that versions wich write
  in log approximately like this:

  02/06 10:29:18 Calling  2:5025/2.0, [1] 52-2448, BUSY: 18 sec
  or like this:
  02/06 10:29:18 Calling  5025/2.0, [1] 52-2448
  02/06 10:29:36 Modem reports: <BUSY>

  3. Startup parameters:

     Some command line parameters can be also specified:

  -P<Period>        - time interval definition
  -S<T-Mail.Log>    - alternative log file definition
  -L<T-Mail.Lng>    - alternative *.LNG file definition
  -C<T-LAN.CTL>     - alternative control file definition
  -G[W][R]          - 72/48 column width busy graphic format
  -Z[T][S]          - make 'T'otal/'S'ummary sessions seems like protected
  -Ntask[,task]     - generating statistics only for listed here tasks
  -M                - switch to 'Multiline' mode
  -Q                - disable poster section
  -H, -?            - this help file

  Example: T-Lan-2.Exe -cT-Lan238.Ctl -n1,2
  starts T-LAN with  configuration  file T-Lan238.Ctl, which processes
  only the first and the second "tasks".

  NOTICE: key  -N  with single listed "task" cancels multiline mode if
  it was given in T-Lan.Ctl.

  4. Installation and everyday work.

     T-LAN is distributed via T-MAIL fileecho conference. Last version
  also may be found on the Internet site http://riddle.spb.ru

     The distribution archive is an archive, named T-LANnnn.RAR, where
  nnn - is a version number; it contains the following files:

     FILE_ID.DIZ  - Information about archive contents
     T-LAN.EXE    - DOS executable
     T-LAN-2.EXE  - OS/2 text-mode executable
     T-LAN.HIS    - History
    *T-LAN.CTL    - Configuration file
    *T-LAN.DOC    - Documentation
    *T-LAN.HLP    - T-LAN help file
    *T-LAN.LNG    - T-LAN language support file

     Files, marked by '*' symbols are contained in distribution kit in
  3 copies and in directories wich correspond to their language:
  Russian\, English\, German\.
     Note: German T-Lan*.Ctl & T-Lan.DOC are not supported any more.

     At  the  first  installation  it  is  necessary  to place archive
  content into some directory and copy there files, wich correspond to
  the  language you choose, from one of subdirectories. Since then you
  may adjust T-Lan.Ctl to your needs.
     If  you  update  T-LAN to a new version you should move all files
  except   T-Lan.Ctl  and  read  attentively  about  changes  in  file
  T-Lan.His.
